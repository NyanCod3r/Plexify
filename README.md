# Plexify

**⚠️ This is a breaking change that drops automatic Plex playlist management in favor of Plex Smart Playlists**

Plexify automatically syncs Spotify playlists to your local filesystem, downloading tracks using `spotdl`. Files are organized by playlist, then artist and album for seamless Plex library integration. Use **Plex Smart Playlists** (filtered by folder path) to surface these files in Plex.

## 🎯 Plex Library Setup (Important!)

**For the upcoming 1-star deletion feature to work, your Plex library structure must match Spotify playlist names.**

### Recommended Setup:

1. **Create separate Plex libraries for each Spotify playlist you want to sync**
   - Library name **must exactly match** Spotify playlist name
   - Example: Spotify playlist `Stoner.Blues.Rock` → Plex library `Stoner.Blues.Rock`

2. **Point each library to its corresponding folder**
   - Library `Stoner.Blues.Rock` → Folder `/data/Music/Stoner.Blues.Rock`
   - Library `Chill.Vibes` → Folder `/data/Music/Chill.Vibes`

3. **Why this matters:**
   - When you rate a track 1-star in Plex, the app will know which Spotify playlist to remove it from
   - The library name acts as the link between Plex and Spotify
   - Without matching names, 1-star deletion won't work

### Example Configuration:

**Spotify Playlists:**
- `Stoner.Blues.Rock`
- `Chill.Vibes`
- `Workout Mix`

**File Structure:**
```
/data/Music/
├── Stoner.Blues.Rock/
│   └── Black Sabbath/...
├── Chill.Vibes/
│   └── Tycho/...
└── Workout Mix/
    └── Run The Jewels/...
```

**Plex Libraries (Settings → Libraries → Add Library):**
- Name: `Stoner.Blues.Rock` → Folder: `/data/Music/Stoner.Blues.Rock`
- Name: `Chill.Vibes` → Folder: `/data/Music/Chill.Vibes`
- Name: `Workout Mix` → Folder: `/data/Music/Workout Mix`

---

## Setting up Plex Smart Playlists

**One-time setup per playlist:**

1. In Plex Web UI, go to **Music** → **Playlists** → **+ New Playlist** → **Smart Playlist**
2. Configure filters:
   - **Type**: `Music`
   - **Folder** → **contains** → `<MUSIC_PATH>/<PlaylistName>`
   - Additional filters as needed (genre, artist, etc.)
3. Save the playlist
4. Plex will automatically include all tracks from matching folders
5. Repeat for each collection you want

**Example Smart Playlist filters:**
- Specific Spotify Playlist: `Folder contains /data/Music/Stoner.Blues.Rock`
- All Rock Artists: `Folder contains /data/Music/Rock` AND `Genre is Rock`
- Specific Artist Across Playlists: `Folder contains /data/Music` AND `Artist is AC/DC`

As Plexify downloads new tracks, your Smart Playlists auto-update. No API calls needed!

## File Organization

```
MUSIC_PATH/
├── Stoner.Blues.Rock/           (Playlist 1 = Plex Library 1)
│   ├── Black Sabbath/
│   │   ├── Paranoid/
│   │   │   ├── War Pigs.mp3
│   │   │   └── Paranoid.mp3
│   │   └── Master of Reality/
│   │       └── Sweet Leaf.mp3
│   └── Kyuss/
│       └── Blues for the Red Sun/
│           └── Thumb.mp3
└── Chill.Vibes/                 (Playlist 2 = Plex Library 2)
    └── Tycho/
        └── Dive/
            └── A Walk.mp3
```

**Structure explained:**
1. **Level 1:** `MUSIC_PATH` - Your root music folder
2. **Level 2:** Spotify playlist name (sanitized for filesystem) - **This must match your Plex library name**
3. **Level 3:** Artist name from track metadata
4. **Level 4:** Album name from track metadata
5. **Level 5:** Track file (`.mp3` or `.flac`)

This structure allows you to:
- Create Plex libraries that map directly to Spotify playlists
- Enable future 1-star deletion (library name = playlist name = folder name)
- Create Plex Smart Playlists per Spotify playlist (`Folder contains /music/Stoner.Blues.Rock`)
- Group all music together while keeping playlists organized
- Easily identify which playlist a track belongs to

## 🔧 Feature Details

### 🚀 Smart Playlist Caching
Plexify uses Spotify's `snapshot_id` to detect playlist changes. This dramatically reduces API calls:

**First run:** Fetches all playlists and tracks  
**Subsequent runs:** Only checks snapshot IDs (1 API call per playlist)  
**If unchanged:** No additional API calls needed  
**If changed:** Only re-fetches that specific playlist

This prevents rate limiting and saves bandwidth.

### 🎵 Intelligent File Organization
Files are organized using Spotify metadata with a 4-level hierarchy:
- Playlist name (sanitized)
- Artist name from track metadata
- Album name from track metadata
- Track name with sanitized filenames (removes invalid characters: `< > : " / \ | ? *`)

Examples:
- `AC/DC` becomes `AC_DC`
- `Stoner.Blues.Rock` becomes `Stoner.Blues.Rock` (dots are valid)
- `My Playlist: Best Of` becomes `My Playlist_ Best Of`

### 🏷️ Metadata Tagging
All downloaded files are automatically tagged with:
- Artist name
- Track title
- Album name
- Album artist

### 📦 Plex Library Compatibility
The `<Playlist>/<Artist>/<Album>/<Track>` structure allows precise Plex Smart Playlist targeting. Point your Plex library at `MUSIC_PATH` and all playlists will be available for filtering.

## 🚧 Upcoming Feature: ⭐ 1-Star Rating Cleanup

**Status:** Implemented but not yet enabled in sync loop

When you rate a track 1-star in Plex, Plexify will:
1. Find which Plex library the track belongs to (e.g., `Stoner.Blues.Rock`)
2. Remove it from the corresponding Spotify playlist
3. Delete the track from your Plex library
4. Delete the local file

**Requirements:**
- Plex library name must exactly match Spotify playlist name
- Track must exist in the corresponding Spotify playlist

**Why disabled?** This feature needs additional testing and user configuration options before being enabled by default.

---

## Migration from v1.x

**Breaking Changes:**
- Environment variables changed: `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` → `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`
- Plex playlist management removed (use Plex Smart Playlists instead)
- File organization changed to `<Playlist>/<Artist>/<Album>/<Track>` structure (added playlist folder level)
- **Plex libraries must now be named to match Spotify playlists** for future 1-star deletion
- Removed bidirectional sync for Discover Weekly/Release Radar
- Added required `PLEX_URL` and `PLEX_TOKEN` variables

**What stays the same:**
- Download functionality
- Spotify playlist fetching
- Basic configuration approach

**Migration steps:**
1. Update environment variable names in your config
2. Set `PLEX_URL` and `PLEX_TOKEN`
3. Point `MUSIC_PATH` to your Plex music library root
4. **Create new Plex libraries with names matching Spotify playlists** (see Plex Library Setup section)
5. Create Plex Smart Playlists to replace old automatic playlists
6. Remove any old Docker volumes or cache files (`spotify_playlists.json` will be recreated)
7. First run will re-download metadata but skip existing files
8. **File reorganization:** Existing files in `<Artist>/<Album>/` will not be moved. New structure is `<Playlist>/<Artist>/<Album>/`. Consider reorganizing manually or starting fresh.

## Troubleshooting

### 🚫 Rate Limiting from Spotify
**Problem:** Logs show `Your application has reached a rate/request limit. Retry will occur after: 86400`

**Solutions:**
1. **Create your own Spotify credentials** instead of using shared public keys
2. Increase `SECONDS_TO_WAIT` to reduce sync frequency (e.g., `7200` for 2 hours)
3. Reduce number of playlists in `SPOTIFY_URIS`
4. Smart caching is enabled by default and should prevent this on subsequent runs

**Why it happens:** Public/shared Spotify API keys hit rate limits quickly. Your own credentials get a fresh quota.

### 📁 Files Not Appearing in Plex
**Problem:** Downloaded files don't show up in Plex

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `MUSIC_PATH` matches your Plex library path exactly
2. Trigger a manual library scan: Plex Web UI → Library → Three-dot menu → Scan Library Files
3. Check Plex scan logs for errors: Settings → Console → Logs
4. Verify file permissions: Plex user needs read access to `MUSIC_PATH`
5. Check if files exist: `ls -la $MUSIC_PATH/<Playlist>/<Artist>/<Album>/`
6. Verify Smart Playlist filter matches folder path exactly
7. **Check library names match playlist names** for proper organization

### ⚠️ Invalid Library Section Error
**Problem:** `Error fetching 1-star tracks from library 'Stoner.Blues.Rock': Invalid library section`

**Cause:** Your Plex library name doesn't match the Spotify playlist name.

**Solution:**
1. Check your Plex library names: Settings → Libraries
2. Rename library to match Spotify playlist exactly (including dots, spaces, capitalization)
3. Or create a new library with the correct name pointing to the playlist folder

**Example:**
- ❌ Plex library: `Music` → Playlist folder: `/data/Music/Stoner.Blues.Rock` (Won't work)
- ✅ Plex library: `Stoner.Blues.Rock` → Playlist folder: `/data/Music/Stoner.Blues.Rock` (Works)

### 💾 Cache Issues
**Problem:** Plexify keeps re-fetching playlists or shows wrong track counts

**Solutions:**
1. Delete cache file: `rm spotify_playlists.json`
2. Restart Plexify (will do a full refresh)
3. Check cache file is valid JSON: `cat spotify_playlists.json | python3 -m json.tool`

### ⏱️ Download Timeouts
**Problem:** Downloads timeout after 300 seconds

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection speed
2. Verify `spotdl` is installed: `spotdl --version`
3. Test manual download: `spotdl 'https://open.spotify.com/track/TRACK_ID'`
4. Check spotdl output in logs for specific errors (YouTube blocks, regional restrictions, etc.)

### 🔇 No Download Progress Visible
**Problem:** Logs stuck at "Downloading: Artist - Track"

**Solution:** Set `SPOTDL_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to see detailed spotdl output. If still stuck for >5 minutes:
1. Check if spotdl process is running: `ps aux | grep spotdl`
2. Kill hung process: `pkill spotdl`
3. Restart Plexify

### 🔄 Environment Variables Not Working
**Problem:** Application can't find environment variables

**Solutions:**
1. Verify variables are exported: `echo $SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`
2. If empty, export again in current shell session
3. For persistent variables, add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID="..."
   export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
   # etc.
   ```
4. Source the file: `source ~/.bashrc`
